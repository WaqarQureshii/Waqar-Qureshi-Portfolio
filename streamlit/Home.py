        Have you ever been looking to invest in the US stock market such as the Nasdaq, S&P500 and the Russel 2000?

Some signals are leading indicators of a bull run, some are after-the-fact indicators of a bull run. \n
        
         The purpose of WTDOLLE (What Transpired During Our Last Encounter) is to answer this very question: what was the general return over a given number of periods when the last time certain signals were given. \n
